Chris Christie of New Jersey isn't going to run. That's too bad. He had a chance to rescue the Republican Party from its dash to the cliff and make President Obama a better leader, too. Here's why: When the G.O.P. presidential candidates were asked during their debate on Aug. 11 whether any of them would accept a budget deal that involved $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases -- and they all said no -- the Republican Party officially became a danger to itself and to the country.", "pub_date": "2011-10-05T00:00:00Z"}

There isn't a single national politician today whom you would describe by those attributes, which is why the fake Jobs obituary published in The Onion, the satirical newspaper, struck such a nerve. It began by saying: ''Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Computers'' -- and the only American in the country who had any clue what he was doing -- ''died Wednesday at the age of 56.'' It went on to quote President Obama as saying that Jobs ''will be remembered both for the life-changing products he created and for the fact that he was able to sit down, think clearly, and execute his ideas -- attributes he shared with no other U.S. citizen. 'This is a dark time for our country, because the reality is none of the 300 million or so Americans who remain can actually get anything done or make things happen.'

Likewise, Americans find horse-eating offensive; a five-year federal ban on slaughtering horses for human consumption was lifted last year. (Chicken-fried horse steak with onion gravy was on the menu at the Harvard Faculty Club until 1985.) Horse meat is consumed in France, just as dog meat is eaten in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tonga, parts of Asia and even Switzerland. In Poland, some ingest dog fat as a curative.

Let's look at both. It was not surprising to hear liberals extolling the legal creativity and courage of Chief Justice Roberts in finding a way to greenlight Obama's Affordable Care Act. But there is something deeper reflected in that praise, and it even touched some conservatives. It's the feeling that it has been so long since a national leader ''surprised'' us. It's the feeling that it has been so long since a national leader ripped up the polls and not only acted out of political character but did so truly for the good of the country -- as Chief Justice Roberts seemingly did.", "pub_date": "2012-06-30T00:00:00Z"}

In the term that ended last week, the Supreme Court reached a liberal outcome in cases involving President Obama's health care law, Arizona's draconian immigration statute and mandatory life sentences for juveniles. But the conservative majority also laid down a cache of weapons that future courts can use to attack many of the legislative achievements of the New Deal and the Great Society -- including labor, environmental, civil rights and consumer protection laws -- and to prevent new progressive legislation. Far from being a source of jubilation, the term may come back to haunt liberals. The immediate result of Thursday's 5-to-4 health care ruling was a victory for the Obama administration and the millions of Americans who will get improved access to medical care. But four justices would have struck down every provision of the 900-plus-page act, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who provided the fifth vote to uphold the mandate that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty, distanced himself from the law. ''It is not our job,'' he wrote, ''to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.'' The chief justice, who at 57 is likely to sit on the court for at least another two decades, made clear that government's ability to address many of the nation's most pressing problems is subject to some new limitations.", "pub_date": "2012-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
