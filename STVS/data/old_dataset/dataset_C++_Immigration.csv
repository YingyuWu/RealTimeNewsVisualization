Maya, as she is called, was nine months pregnant (to the day), and while she was onstage rapping about ''some some some I some I murder, some I some I let go'' -- in a black skintight, body-stocking dress, transparent except for polka-dot patches that strategically covered her belly, breasts and derri\u00e8re -- she began to experience contractions. As the pain hit, Maya was performing with the male titans of rap (Jay-Z, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, T.I.) and she later told me that she thought all the free-floating testosterone caused her to go into labor. While American rappers today tend to celebrate sex, wealth and status, Maya, who grew up listening to the politicized rhymes of Public Enemy, takes international dance beats and meshes them with the very un-American voice of the militant rebel. In contrast to, say, Bono or John Lennon, with their peacenik messages, Maya taps into her rage at the persecution of Tamils in Sri Lanka to espouse violence: while you're under the sway of the beat, she's rapping, ''You wanna win a war?/Like P.L.O. I don't surrender.'' Although her publicist had a wheelchair ready and a midwife on call, Maya, who has a deep and instinctive affinity for the provocative, knew that this Grammy moment was not to be missed. It had everything: artistic credibility, high drama, a massive audience. The baby would just have to wait. The combination of being nearly naked, hugely pregnant, singing incendiary lyrics and having the eyes of the world upon her was too much to resist.

Mr. Grimm has also shown decidedly poor judgment in his choice of backers and friends. When he first ran for the House, two years ago, his campaign collected more than $500,000 from followers of Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, an Orthodox rabbi and mystic from Israel. Mr. Grimm's main contact with the group was Ofer Biton, a top aide of the rabbi, who is now under investigation by federal prosecutors over accusations that he embezzled millions of dollars from the rabbi's congregation. Several of the rabbi's followers interviewed by The Times said Mr. Biton aggressively sought donations for Mr. Grimm in hopes that he would be able to get an immigration green card once Mr. Grimm was in office. One donor, speaking anonymously to avoid involvement in the investigation, told The Times Mr. Grimm had him hand over $5,000 in cash during the 2010 campaign; another told of repeated demands from the candidate for thousands of dollars beyond legal limits.", "pub_date": "2012-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
