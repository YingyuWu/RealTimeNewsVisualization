After all, the tactic of sitting down and refusing to move was used by angry veterans marching on Washington in the early Depression years, striking automobile workers in the late 1930s and civil rights protesters in the 1960s. But there is a local precedent, one that few people remember today: the sit-ins and ''occupations'' that followed New York City's deep budget cuts in 1975 and 1976. In the spring of 1975, amid a recession and mounting anxiety about municipal bookkeeping, the banks that had long marketed the city's bonds refused to do so any longer. To regain access to the bond market, and under pressure from Albany and Washington, Mayor Abraham D. Beame proposed a series of austerity budgets, slashing funds for schools, libraries and firehouses and, for the first time, charging tuition for the City University of New York.", "pub_date": "2011-10-20T00:00:00Z"}

Herman Cain, the long-shot Republican presidential hopeful who took first place in last month's Florida straw poll, certainly seems to think so. Since ''This Is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House'' was released on Oct. 4, the former Godfather's Pizza executive has been spending an awful lot of time in bookstores, signing copies and doing riffs on exclamation-point-happy policy prescriptions like ''Natural resources are there for a reason. Use them!''(Anyone else want to hear those guys from the Miller Lite commercials stage a shout-off between Cain's ''Nine, nine, nine!'' slogan -- a reference to his flat-tax plan -- and the Occupy Wall Street movement's ''We are the 99 percent''?) It took Cain about three months and a few professional collaborators to write the rather slender book, but less than one day after official publication to hit the top 10 on Amazon. According to his publisher, Threshold Editions, the book has already gone back for a sixth printing, with some 100,000 copies in circulation. Recent polls have shown Cain surging in New Hampshire and pulling even with Mitt Romney in Virginia, and the best-seller horse race is equally hard to call: Romney's ''No Apology: The Case for American Greatness'' may have gone straight to No. 1 on the hardcover list in March 2010, but his campaign's new policy treatise, ''Believe in America,'' has been hovering around No. 500 in Amazon's free e-book store. If Cain has been criticized for not spending enough time in New Hampshire (which does have four Barnes & Noble stores, after all), he's already thinking ahead to his first state visit to Uzbekistan (which seems to have none). ''When they ask me who's the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I'm going to say, 'You know, I don't know. Do you know?' '' he told a television interviewer.

It doesn't get any more immoral than this. As the Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint noted, in 2007, Citigroup exercised ''significant influence'' over choosing $500 million of the $1 billion worth of assets in the deal, and the global bank deliberately chose collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, built from mortgage loans almost sure to fail. According to The Wall Street Journal, the S.E.C. complaint quoted one unnamed C.D.O. trader outside Citigroup as describing the portfolio as resembling something your dog leaves on your neighbor's lawn. ''The deal became largely worthless within months of its creation,'' The Journal added.
